The solution is to simply add the missing semicolon:

```css
.container {
  width: 500px;
  .inner {
    background-color: lightblue;
    /* Semicolon added */
  }
}
```
Adding the semicolon ensures that each declaration within the nested selector is correctly terminated.  This prevents any unintended style cascade effects.
